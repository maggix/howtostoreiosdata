            Based on your answers, your best option would be to use a
            <strong>{{ recommendation.get_storage_display }}</strong> storage with
            the <strong>{{ recommendation.protection_level_full_name }}</strong> protection.

            {{ recommendation.protection_level_explanation }}

            <p>
                The iOS Keychain is an efficient and secure storage, meant for small bits of sensitive data, like passwords
                or API tokens. It is not meant for data more than a few kilobytes. In that way, it is a little bit like
                NSUserDefaults. But when it comes to  security, NSUserDefaults offers none at all, and Keychain was designed specifically
                with security in mind.

        {% if chosen_sharing %}
            <p>
                You may prefer to use another storage method, but Keychain is your only option to securely share
                data with other apps, by using Keychain access groups.

    <p>This is, as anything, a work in progress. Do you think the code sample can be improved?
